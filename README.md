# Coursera_Machine_Learning 
This repository is a variation about  Machine Learning based on the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) I've taken on Coursera. 
The original author of this course is [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng). 

Among solving standard tasks from The course which are written in the [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave), I have added my own interpretation in python. I hope that it will inspire other people, and it will help them solve Their problems.
